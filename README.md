## Project Purpose

This project was developed as an experimental learning project while transitioning into **Jetpack Compose**.

The goal was to gain practical experience with Compose while keeping the architecture clean and scalable.  
It focuses on:
- Compose UI fundamentals
- State-driven UI
- Clean Architecture with Hilt integration

The project is intentionally simple and serves as a foundation for further improvements and experimentation.
